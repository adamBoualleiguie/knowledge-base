# Building a Modern Portfolio Website

In this post, I'll share how I built this portfolio website using modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

The website is built with:

- **Next.js 14** - For the React framework
- **Contentlayer** - For content management
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **TypeScript** - For type safety

## Key Features

1. **MDX Support** - Write content in Markdown with React components
2. **Dark Mode** - Automatic dark mode support
3. **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
4. **Fast Performance** - Optimized for speed

## Lessons Learned

Building this website taught me a lot about:

- Content management with MDX
- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript best practices
- Tailwind CSS utility classes

## Conclusion

I'm really happy with how this turned out! The combination of Next.js and Contentlayer makes it easy to manage content while maintaining a great developer experience.
