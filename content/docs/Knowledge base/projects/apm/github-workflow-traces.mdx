# Collecting GitHub Actions Traces with OpenTelemetry and SigNoz

GitHub Actions and similar CI/CD solutions are crucial for automation, maintainability, and project lifecycle management. They help enforce standards and keep things clean — but when it comes to **workflow observability**, what are we really talking about?

## The Problem

Normally, when a DevOps or SRE engineer looks at GitHub Actions, they see:
- Individual actions and steps
- Workflows separated by repository
- Failures (maybe) — if someone reports them
- Performance issues — only when developers complain

But imagine managing a complex project with many GitHub workflows, hundreds of steps, and countless moving parts. How do you know:
- What are the bottlenecks?
- Where are the issues?
- What's causing latency?
- What's the success rate of a given action?

You need **performance KPIs**, **metrics**, and **traces** that tell you the health of your workflows. That's exactly what we're going to implement.

In this guide, I'm going to show you how to collect traces from your GitHub repository workflows and actions, and provide a dashboard with traces and metrics that will help you improve, detect anomalies early, and optimize your GitHub Actions workflows.

---

## Architecture Overview

For this demo, I have the following environment setup:
- **k3s cluster** — lightweight Kubernetes
- **SigNoz** — installed in k3s
- **OpenTelemetry Operator** — installed and ready

Here's how the architecture works:

1. **GitHub repository** with a configured webhook pointing to a public URL (I'm using an ngrok URL for demo purposes)
2. **ngrok** exposing an OpenTelemetry Collector with GitHub receiver via NodePort service
3. **OpenTelemetry Collector** created by the OTel Collector CR, pointing to SigNoz as the exporter backend
4. **SigNoz UI** to visualize and analyze traces
---

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:
- A Kubernetes cluster (I'm using k3s)
- SigNoz installed and running
- OpenTelemetry Operator installed
- A GitHub repository with admin access
- ngrok or another tunneling solution for exposing the webhook endpoint

<Callout type="note" title="Demo Environment">
I'm using ngrok for this demo to expose the webhook endpoint publicly. In production, you'd want to use a proper ingress controller or a cloud load balancer.
</Callout>

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

First, we need to create a **Fine-grained Personal Access Token** in GitHub. Even though we're not scraping in this setup, GitHub forces us to configure a scraper — this is mentioned in the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib source code for the GitHub receiver.

<Callout type="warning" title="Why a Token is Required">
Check this out: the GitHub receiver source code requires a scraper configuration even if you're only using webhooks. See the [GitHub receiver config](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/49743ba8ca81d2a5080dc9b6e7aee7929b881ae1/receiver/githubreceiver/config.go#L73) for details.
</Callout>

Let's create the token:

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Give it a name like "GitHub Actions Observability"
4. Set expiration (I'm using 90 days for this demo)
5. Select the repository you want to monitor
6. Grant the following permissions:
   - `actions: read` — to read workflow information
   - `metadata: read` — to read repository metadata

<Callout type="note" title="Save Your Token">
Make sure to copy the token immediately — you won't be able to see it again. We'll add it to a Kubernetes secret in the next step.
</Callout>

---

## Step 2: Setup OpenTelemetry Collector with GitHub Receiver

Now I'm going to create the OpenTelemetry Collector configuration with the GitHub receiver. This collector will receive webhook events from GitHub and convert them into traces.

### Create the Secret

First, let's create a Kubernetes secret with the GitHub token and webhook secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: github-webhook-secret
  namespace: opentelemetry-operator-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  secret: topsecret
  github-token: YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Security Note">
Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token, and change `topsecret` to a strong random string for the webhook secret.
</Callout>

### Create the OpenTelemetry Collector

Now let's create the OpenTelemetry Collector Custom Resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1beta1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: otel-github
  namespace: opentelemetry-operator-system
spec:
  mode: deployment

  # Using the official opentelemetry-collector-contrib image
  image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.141.0
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent

  env:
    - name: GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: github-webhook-secret
          key: secret

    - name: GITHUB_TOKEN
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: github-webhook-secret
          key: github-token

  config:
    extensions:
      bearertokenauth/github:
        token: ${env:GITHUB_TOKEN}

    receivers:
      github:
        webhook:
          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:19418
          path: /events
          health_path: /health
          secret: ${env:GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET}
          service_name: github-webhooks

        # This became mandatory — I checked the GitHub receiver source code
        # See: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/49743ba8ca81d2a5080dc9b6e7aee7929b881ae1/receiver/githubreceiver/config.go#L73
        scrapers:
          scraper:
            github_org: YOUR_GITHUB_ORG
            auth:
              authenticator: bearertokenauth/github

    processors:
      memory_limiter:
        check_interval: 1s
        limit_mib: 512
      batch: {}

    exporters:
      otlp/signoz:
        endpoint: signoz-otel-collector.signoz.svc.cluster.local:4317
        tls:
          insecure: true

      debug:
        verbosity: detailed

    service:
      extensions: [bearertokenauth/github]

      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [github]
          processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
          exporters: [otlp/signoz, debug]

        metrics:
          receivers: [github]
          processors: [memory_limiter, batch]
          exporters: [otlp/signoz]
```

<Callout type="note" title="Configuration Details">
- Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_ORG` with your GitHub organization or username
- The webhook endpoint is set to `/events` on port `19418`
- The health check endpoint is at `/health`
- Traces and metrics are exported to SigNoz via OTLP
</Callout>

### Expose the Webhook Service

Now we need to expose the webhook service so GitHub can reach it. For this demo, I'm using a NodePort service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: otel-github-webhook
  namespace: opentelemetry-operator-system
spec:
  type: NodePort   # For demo purposes — using ngrok to expose publicly
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: opentelemetry-operator-system.otel-github
    app.kubernetes.io/component: opentelemetry-collector
  ports:
    - name: github-webhook
      port: 19418
      targetPort: 19418
      nodePort: 31942   # Optional if using NodePort
```

Apply these resources:

<Terminal
  title="Apply OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration"
  commands={[
    {
      command: 'kubectl apply -f github-secret.yaml --kubeconfig k3s-signoz-cluster.yaml',
      output: 'secret/github-webhook-secret created'
    },
    {
      command: 'kubectl apply -f otel-collector-github.yaml --kubeconfig k3s-signoz-cluster.yaml',
      output: 'opentelemetrycollector.opentelemetry.io/otel-github created'
    },
    {
      command: 'kubectl apply -f github-webhook-service.yaml --kubeconfig k3s-signoz-cluster.yaml',
      output: 'service/otel-github-webhook created'
    },
    {
      command: 'kubectl get pods -n opentelemetry-operator-system | grep otel-github',
      output: 'otel-github-collector-7d8f9c4b5-abc123   1/1     Running   0          2m'
    }
  ]}
/>

---

## Step 3: Expose the Webhook Endpoint

Since we're running this in a local k3s cluster, we need to expose the webhook service publicly so GitHub can reach it. I'm using ngrok for this demo.

<Terminal
  title="Expose Webhook with ngrok"
  commands={[
    {
      command: 'ngrok http http://K3S_NODE_IP:31942',
      output: 'Forwarding                    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://192.168.1.100:31942'
    }
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="note" title="Production Setup">
In production, you'd use a proper ingress controller (like nginx-ingress or Traefik) with a domain name and TLS certificates. For this demo, ngrok works perfectly.
</Callout>

---

## Step 4: Configure GitHub Webhook

Now I'm going to configure the webhook in GitHub to send events to our OpenTelemetry Collector.

### Create the Webhook

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Webhooks**
3. Click **Add webhook**
4. Configure the webhook:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/events`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: The same secret you used in the Kubernetes secret (in my case, `topsecret`)
   - **Which events**: Select **Let me select individual events**
   - Enable:
     - `workflow_run` — to track workflow runs
     - `workflow_job` — to track individual job executions

<Callout type="warning" title="Important: Add /events to URL">
Make sure you add `/events` to your exposed webhook URL. The GitHub receiver expects webhook events at the `/events` path.
</Callout>

<DocImage
  src="/assets/docs/images/knowledge-base/projects/apm/githubwebhook.png"
  alt="GitHub webhook configuration"
  caption="Configuring the GitHub webhook with workflow_run and workflow_job events"
/>

<DocImage
  src="/assets/docs/images/knowledge-base/projects/apm/githubwebhook2.png"
  alt="GitHub webhook events selection"
  caption="Selecting workflow_run and workflow_job events for the webhook"
/>

### Test the Webhook

After creating the webhook, GitHub will send a test delivery. You can check if it was received successfully:

<DocImage
  src="/assets/docs/images/knowledge-base/projects/apm/githubwebhook3.png"
  alt="GitHub webhook test delivery"
  caption="Testing the webhook delivery in GitHub"
/>

<Callout type="success" title="Webhook Configured">
If you see a successful delivery (200 response), your webhook is configured correctly and GitHub can reach your OpenTelemetry Collector!
</Callout>

---

## Step 5: Test the Setup

Now let's test the entire setup. I'm going to trigger a workflow by creating a PR and merging it to main. Since we're in a knowledge base repo, I'll use a simple workflow action that updates the website via GitHub Pages.

When the PR is merged and the workflow starts in the main branch, we should see traces appearing in SigNoz.

<Callout type="info" title="What to Expect">
You should see traces for:
- Workflow run events
- Individual job executions
- Step-level traces
- Duration and status information
</Callout>

### Viewing Traces in SigNoz

After the workflow runs, navigate to SigNoz and check the traces:

<DocImage
  src="/assets/docs/images/knowledge-base/projects/apm/githubtraces1.png"
  alt="GitHub workflow traces in SigNoz"
  caption="GitHub Actions workflow traces visible in SigNoz"
/>

<DocImage
  src="/assets/docs/images/knowledge-base/projects/apm/githubtraces2.png"
  alt="Detailed GitHub workflow trace"
  caption="Detailed view of a GitHub Actions workflow trace showing individual steps"
/>

<Highlight color="green"> Perfect! We've successfully set up observability for GitHub Actions workflows. </Highlight>

---

## What We've Achieved

Now we can:
- **Detect anomalies** in workflow execution
- **Identify bottlenecks** in CI/CD pipelines
- **Track performance metrics** for each workflow
- **Monitor success rates** across different actions
- **Get early warnings** when workflows start to degrade

This observability setup will help you:
- Optimize slow workflows
- Debug failures faster
- Understand workflow dependencies
- Track improvements over time

---

## Next Steps

In the next document, I'm going to show you how to enhance this setup to also collect **GitHub workflow metrics**. This is a simple addition to the collector configuration that will give you even more insights into your CI/CD pipeline performance.

<Callout type="note" title="Metrics Enhancement">
The metrics enhancement is just a small addition to the collector CR — we'll add metric-specific processors and exporters to get detailed performance data.
</Callout>

---

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

If you're not seeing traces in SigNoz:
1. Check the webhook delivery logs in GitHub
2. Verify the ngrok tunnel is still active
3. Check the OpenTelemetry Collector logs: `kubectl logs -n opentelemetry-operator-system -l app.kubernetes.io/component=opentelemetry-collector`
4. Ensure the webhook secret matches in both GitHub and the Kubernetes secret

### Collector Not Starting

If the collector pod isn't running:
1. Check pod status: `kubectl get pods -n opentelemetry-operator-system`
2. Check pod logs: `kubectl logs -n opentelemetry-operator-system <pod-name>`
3. Verify the secret exists and has the correct keys
4. Check the OpenTelemetry Collector CR for syntax errors

### No Traces in SigNoz

If traces aren't appearing in SigNoz:
1. Verify SigNoz is running: `kubectl get pods -n signoz`
2. Check the OTLP exporter endpoint is correct
3. Verify network connectivity between collector and SigNoz
4. Check the collector debug logs for export errors

---

## Summary

We've successfully set up observability for GitHub Actions workflows using:
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** with GitHub receiver
- **GitHub webhooks** for real-time event delivery
- **SigNoz** for trace visualization and analysis

This setup gives you complete visibility into your CI/CD pipeline, helping you detect issues early and optimize performance. The traces show you exactly what's happening in your workflows, when it's happening, and how long each step takes.

<Callout type="success" title="You're All Set!">
Your GitHub Actions observability is now live. Every workflow run will generate traces that you can analyze in SigNoz to improve your CI/CD pipeline.
</Callout>
