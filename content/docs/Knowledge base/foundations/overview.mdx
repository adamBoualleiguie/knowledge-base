# Foundations

This section contains core concepts and vendor-neutral knowledge. Here you'll learn how things actually work, without being tied to a specific provider or tool.

## Philosophy

> No tutorials tied to a specific provider here.  
> Only **how things actually work**.

## Topics Covered

- **Linux**: Systemd, networking, storage, security basics
- **Containers**: Docker internals, container networking, container storage, image optimization
- **Kubernetes Core**: Architecture, control plane, scheduling, networking, storage, security
