# Architectures

This section covers design patterns, tradeoffs, and architectural decisions. This is where you understand the "why" behind design choices.

## What's Covered

- **Small-Scale**: Homelab, startup architectures
- **Medium-Scale**: Multi-cluster, HA platform designs
- **Enterprise**: Secure platforms, observability at scale, multi-cloud

## Architecture Documentation

Each architecture doc includes:

- **Diagram**: Visual representation of the architecture
- **Why This Design**: Rationale and decision-making process
- **Tradeoffs**: What you gain and what you sacrifice
- **Alternatives**: Other approaches considered
- **Cost & Complexity Notes**: Practical considerations
