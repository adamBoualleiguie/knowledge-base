# Background Jobs

Background jobs are tasks that run **in the background**, independently of what the user is doing. They help your system handle work without making users wait.  

<Callout type="info" title="Why use background jobs?">
Background jobs are perfect for tasks that are **time-consuming, repetitive, or triggered by events**, without blocking the main application flow.
</Callout>

Common uses include:

- **Maintenance tasks:** cleaning old data, generating reports, or backing up databases.  
- **Data processing:** importing, exporting, transforming large datasets.  
- **Notifications:** sending emails, push notifications, or system messages.  
- **Long-running computations:** analytics, machine learning, or complex calculations.  

# Types of Background Jobs

<TabbedContent>

<TabPanel id="event-driven" label="Event-Driven Jobs">
Event-driven background jobs are triggered by **events** happening in the system.

Examples:
- A message is added to a queue (like a new order). The job reads it and processes it asynchronously.  
- A database value changes. The job detects the change and runs automatically.  
- A request hits an API endpoint. The job runs using the data from that request.  

<Callout type="success" title="Tip">
Event-driven jobs are **reactive**: they only run when triggered. Perfect for tasks tied to user actions or system events.
</Callout>
</TabPanel>

<TabPanel id="schedule-driven" label="Schedule-Driven Jobs">
Schedule-driven background jobs run **on a timer**, starting at specific intervals or times.

Examples:
- A timer inside your app triggers a task every hour or day.  
- An external service like Azure Logic Apps hits an API at scheduled times.  
- A separate process starts a timer that runs once after a delay or at a fixed time.  

Common use cases:
- Batch processing: updating product recommendations, syncing user data.  
- Routine updates: recalculating indexes, generating daily reports.  
- Cleanup and consistency checks: removing stale data, validating data integrity.  

<Callout type="warning" title="Watch out">
Schedule-driven jobs are **predictable**: they run whether or not users interact with the system. Make sure schedules don’t overlap and overload resources.
