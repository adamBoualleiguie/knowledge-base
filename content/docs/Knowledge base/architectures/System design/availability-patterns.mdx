# Availability Patterns

Availability patterns are established architectural approaches used to ensure a system remains operational and accessible to users, even in the face of failures or unexpected events. These patterns focus on minimizing downtime and maintaining a consistent level of service by incorporating redundancy, fault tolerance, and recovery mechanisms into the system's design. They provide a structured way to address potential points of failure and ensure business continuity.

# Availability in Numbers

<TabbedContent>
  <TabPanel id="three-9s" label="99.9% Availability - Three 9s">
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Duration</th>
      <th>Acceptable downtime</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Downtime per year</td>
      <td>8h 41min 38s</td>

## Availability in Parallel vs in Sequence

<TabbedContent>
  <TabPanel id="in-sequence" label="In Sequence">
    Overall availability decreases when two components with availability &lt; 100% are in sequence:

    ```bash
    Availability (Total) = Availability (Foo) * Availability (Bar)
    ```

    Example: If both Foo and Bar each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in sequence would be 99.8%.
  </TabPanel>

  <TabPanel id="in-parallel" label="In Parallel">
    Overall availability increases when two components with availability &lt; 100% are in parallel:

    ```bash
    Availability (Total) = 1 - (1 - Availability (Foo)) * (1 - Availability (Bar))
    ```

    Example: If both Foo and Bar each had 99.9% availability, their total availability in parallel would be 99.9999%.

# Availability Patterns

<TabbedContent>
  <TabPanel id="replication" label="Replication">
    ### Replication

    Replication is an availability pattern that involves having multiple copies of the same data stored in different locations. In the event of a failure, the data can be retrieved from a different location. There are two main types of replication: Master-Master replication and Master-Slave replication.

    **Master-Master replication:** Multiple servers are configured as "masters," each accepting read and write operations. Provides high availability, but requires conflict resolution.

    **Master-Slave replication:** One server is the "master" handling writes, and multiple "slaves" handle reads. If the master fails, a slave is promoted. Simpler to maintain.
  </TabPanel>

  <TabPanel id="failover" label="Failover">
    ### Failover

    Failover ensures a system continues functioning if a component fails, using a backup component or system.

    **Active-Passive:** Heartbeats are sent between active and passive servers. If the heartbeat fails, the passive server takes over. Only the active handles traffic. Also called master-slave failover.

    **Active-Active:** Both servers manage traffic, balancing the load. DNS or application logic must handle multiple active IPs. Also called master-master failover.

    **Disadvantages:** Adds hardware and complexity; potential data loss if active fails before replication.

# SLI, SLO & SLA

<Callout type="info" title="Understanding Availability Terms">
SLI, SLO, and SLA are fundamental concepts to measure and manage service availability. They help define the performance indicators, objectives, and contractual agreements for maintaining availability and reliability.
</Callout>

<TabbedContent>
  <TabPanel id="sli" label="SLI">
    ### Service Level Indicator (SLI)

    SLI is a quantitative metric that measures the performance of a service. It indicates how well a service is performing in terms of availability, latency, or error rate.
  </TabPanel>

  <TabPanel id="slo" label="SLO">
    ### Service Level Objective (SLO)

    SLO is a goal that a service aims to achieve based on SLIs. It defines the target performance and acceptable error thresholds over a defined period.
  </TabPanel>

  <TabPanel id="sla" label="SLA">
    ### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

    SLA is a formal contract between a service provider and consumer, outlining the performance expectations and penalties for failing to meet the agreed SLOs.
