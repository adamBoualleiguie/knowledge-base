## What is version control?

Imagine writing a long document and saving it as `final.docx`, then `final-v2.docx`, then `final-really-final.docx`. Now imagine doing that with hundreds of files, with multiple people editing them at the same time. Things get messy very fast.

Version control exists to solve <Highlight color="green">this exact problem</Highlight>.

At its core, version control is a system that keeps track of <Highlight color="green">every change made to files over time</Highlight>. It remembers what changed, when it changed, and who made the change. Instead of guessing or relying on manual backups, you always have a clear and reliable history of your project.

It allows you to:
- Go back to <Highlight color="green">any previous version</Highlight> of a file
- See <Highlight color="green">exactly what changed</Highlight> between two points in time
- <Highlight color="green">Experiment freely</Highlight> without breaking the main project
- Understand <Highlight color="green">how a project evolved</Highlight> over time

You can think of version control as a <Highlight color="green">time machine for your code and documents</Highlight>.

## Why do we use version control?

Version control is not just for large teams or big companies. It becomes useful the moment a project starts <Highlight color="green">growing beyond a single file or person</Highlight>.

Here’s why it’s essential:

- **Safe collaboration**  
  <Highlight color="green">Multiple people can work at the same time</Highlight> without overwriting each other’s work.

- **History and accountability**  
  <Highlight color="green">Every change is recorded</Highlight>. If something breaks, you can see what changed and who did it.

- **Easy rollback**  
  If a bug is introduced, you can <Highlight color="green">quickly return to a known working state</Highlight>.

- **Parallel work**  
  Features, fixes, and experiments can be <Highlight color="green">developed independently</Highlight> and merged later.

- **Confidence to experiment**  
  You can try new ideas without fear, knowing you can always revert.  
  <Highlight color="red">Without version control, experimentation is risky and stressful.</Highlight>

In short, version control turns <Highlight color="green">chaos into structure</Highlight> and <Highlight color="green">guesswork into certainty</Highlight>.

## Git and Version Control Systems

<TabbedContent>
  <TabPanel id="vcs" label="Version Control System (VCS)">
    A Version Control System (VCS) is the <Highlight color="green">general concept</Highlight> and tooling used to track changes in files over time.

    There are many types of VCS:
    - <Highlight color="green">Centralized systems</Highlight> (like SVN)
    - <Highlight color="green">Distributed systems</Highlight> (like Git)

    A VCS defines how history is stored, how collaboration works, and how changes are shared.  
    Git is <Highlight color="green">one implementation</Highlight> of these ideas, <Highlight color="red">not the idea itself</Highlight>.
  </TabPanel>

  <TabPanel id="git" label="Git">
    Git is a <Highlight color="green">distributed version control system</Highlight> created to handle projects of <Highlight color="green">any size</Highlight> efficiently.

    What makes Git special is that <Highlight color="green">every developer has a full copy of the project history</Highlight> locally. This means:
    - <Highlight color="green">You can work offline</Highlight>
    - <Highlight color="green">Operations are extremely fast</Highlight>
    - <Highlight color="green">There is no single point of failure</Highlight>

    Git is now the <Highlight color="green">industry standard</Highlight> for version control and is used everywhere: open-source projects, startups, and large enterprises.

## Learning Git the right way

Git can feel confusing at first, especially with concepts like branches, rebases, and merges.  
<Highlight color="red">Reading alone is often not enough.</Highlight>
