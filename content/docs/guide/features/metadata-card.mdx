# Metadata Card

The Metadata Card is a sidebar component that displays important information about your blog posts and documentation pages, including author, read time, last updated date, and tags.

## Overview

The Metadata Card provides readers with quick access to key information about your content:

- **Author** - Who wrote the content (with optional profile photo)
- **Read Time** - Estimated reading time (automatically calculated)
- **Last Updated** - When the content was last modified
- **Tags** - Relevant tags for categorization

## Blog Posts

Metadata cards are **automatically displayed** on all blog posts. The card appears on the right side of the page (on desktop) and includes all available metadata.

### Example Blog Post Frontmatter

```mdx
---
title: Building a Modern Portfolio Website
description: Learn how I built this portfolio website using Next.js and Contentlayer
publishedAt: 2024-01-20
updatedAt: 2024-01-25
author: Your Name
authorPhoto: your-name.jpg
tags: [nextjs, web-development, portfolio]
---
```

The metadata card will automatically show:
- Author: "Your Name" (with circular profile photo if provided)
- Read Time: Calculated from content (e.g., "5 min read")
- Last Updated: "Jan 25, 2024"
- Tags: nextjs, web-development, portfolio

## Documentation Pages

For documentation pages, metadata cards are **optional** and can be enabled per document using the `showMetadata` field in the frontmatter.

### Enabling Metadata Card in Docs

Add `showMetadata: true` to your document's frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: Getting Started Guide
description: A comprehensive guide to getting started
publishedAt: 2024-01-01
updatedAt: 2024-01-15
author: Your Name
tags: [guide, tutorial, getting-started]
showMetadata: true
---
```

### Disabling Metadata Card

By default, metadata cards are **hidden** in documentation. If you don't want to show the metadata card, simply omit the `showMetadata` field or set it to `false`:

```mdx
---
title: Quick Reference
description: A quick reference guide
publishedAt: 2024-01-01
showMetadata: false
---
```

## Available Fields

### Required Fields

- `title` - The title of the content
- `publishedAt` - Publication date (used for "Last Updated" if `updatedAt` is not provided)

### Optional Fields

- `author` - Author name (string)
- `authorPhoto` - Path to author profile photo (string)
  - Can be a full path: `/assets/authors/author.jpg`
  - Or just the filename: `author.jpg` (will be resolved to `/assets/authors/author.jpg`)
  - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
  - Photo will be displayed as a circular profile picture
- `updatedAt` - Last update date (if not provided, uses `publishedAt`)
- `tags` - Array of tags (e.g., `[tag1, tag2, tag3]`)
- `showMetadata` - Boolean to show/hide metadata card (docs only, defaults to `false`)

## Read Time Calculation

Read time is automatically calculated based on word count:
- Average reading speed: 200 words per minute
- Rounded up to the nearest minute
- Only displayed if greater than 0

## Layout

### Desktop

On desktop screens (≥1024px), the metadata card appears:
- **Blog posts**: Right side of the content area
- **Documentation**: Right side, above the Table of Contents (if enabled)

### Mobile/Tablet

On smaller screens, the metadata card is hidden to save space. The information is still available in the page header or can be accessed through other means.

## Author Photos

You can display author profile photos in the metadata card, similar to SigNoz's design. The photo appears as a circular profile picture next to the author name.

### Setting Up Author Photos

1. **Create the directory** (if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   public/assets/authors/
   ```

2. **Add author photos** to this directory:
   - Use lowercase filenames with hyphens for spaces
   - Example: `dhruv-ahuja.jpg`, `john-doe.png`
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

3. **Reference in frontmatter**:
   ```mdx
   ---
   author: Dhruv Ahuja
   authorPhoto: dhruv-ahuja.jpg
   ---
   ```

   Or use a full path:
   ```mdx
   ---
   author: Dhruv Ahuja
   authorPhoto: /assets/authors/dhruv-ahuja.jpg
   ---
   ```

### Photo Display

- Photos are displayed as **circular profile pictures** (40x40px)
- If no photo is provided, a user icon is shown instead
- Photos are automatically optimized by Next.js Image component
- Photos work in both light and dark themes

## Styling

The metadata card features:
- Clean, card-based design
- Circular author profile photos (when provided)
- Icons for each metadata type (fallback when no photo)
- Responsive layout
- Sticky positioning (stays visible while scrolling)
- Consistent with your theme (dark/light mode)

## Examples

**Note:** Make sure the author photo file (`dhruv-ahuja.jpg`) exists in `public/assets/authors/` directory.

### Documentation with Metadata (Including Author Photo)

```mdx

title: API Reference
description: Complete API reference documentation

author: Development Team
authorPhoto: /assets/authors/team.jpg
tags: [api, reference, documentation]
showMetadata: true

### Documentation without Metadata

```mdx

```

## Best Practices

1. **Always include `updatedAt`** - Helps readers know when content was last updated
2. **Use relevant tags** - Tags help with discoverability and categorization
3. **Include author information** - Especially useful for team documentation
4. **Add author photos** - Profile photos make content more personal and professional
5. **Use consistent naming** - Use lowercase with hyphens for author photo filenames (e.g., `john-doe.jpg`)
6. **Optimize photos** - Keep author photos small (recommended: 200x200px or less) for faster loading
7. **Enable selectively in docs** - Only enable `showMetadata` for important or frequently updated documentation pages

## Integration with Other Features

The metadata card works seamlessly with:
- **Table of Contents** - In docs, appears above the TOC on the right sidebar
- **Responsive Design** - Automatically hides on mobile devices
- **Theme System** - Adapts to light/dark mode
- **Reading Progress** - Positioned to stay visible while scrolling
