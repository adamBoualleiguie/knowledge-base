# Quick Start

Get your portfolio website up and running in minutes.

<Callout type="info" title="Info">
I instrumented a sample Python Application and sent data to both Datadog and Elastic Stack to evaluate my experience. Some takeaways are subjective and based on personal preference.
</Callout>

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev
```

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a simple architecture:

1. **Content MDX Files**: Your documentation and blog content written in MDX format
2. **Contentlayer**: Processes and transforms MDX files into structured data
3. **Next.js Pages**: Renders the content as static pages
4. **Static Site**: The final generated static website
5. **Users**: Access the website through their browsers

## Code Examples

Here are examples of different programming languages:

### YAML Configuration

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: node:20
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
```

### Java Example

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### C Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Create Your First Document

1. Create a file in `content/docs/` (for example, `network_security_config.xml`):

<Callout type="note">
When merging this configuration with `otelcol-config.yml`, be aware that array values like `exporters` replace existing values. Always ensure `spanmetrics` is included in the trace pipeline to avoid runtime errors.
</Callout>

```mdx

# My First Document

This is my first document!
```

2. The document will automatically appear in the sidebar.

## Create Your First Blog Post

1. Create a file in `content/blog/`:

```mdx
---
title: My First Blog Post
description: A sample blog post
publishedAt: 2024-01-15
author: Your Name
tags: [tutorial, getting-started]
---

# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog!
```

2. The post will appear in the blog listing.

## Using Callout Components

You can use different types of callouts in your documentation:

<Callout type="info">
This is an info callout with helpful information.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="Success">
This is a success callout indicating something completed successfully.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
This is a warning callout for important cautions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note" title="Note">
This is a note callout for additional context. You can reference files like `network_security_config.xml` or directories like `opentelemetry-demo` and they will be highlighted.
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger" title="Danger">
This is a danger callout in red for critical warnings or dangerous operations.
</Callout>
