# CI/CD

This section is explicitly separated because CI/CD evolves constantly. Here you can compare tools without mixing content.

## What's Covered

- **Concepts**: Pipelines, runners, artifacts
- **GitLab**: Runners, Kubernetes integration, advanced pipelines
- **GitHub Actions**: Self-hosted runners, workflows
- **Azure DevOps**: Pipelines and integrations
- **And more...**

## Structure

```

## Why Separate?

CI/CD tools are constantly evolving. By separating them, you can:
- Compare tools side-by-side
- Update one tool's docs without affecting others
- Find what you need quickly
