# Knowledge Base

Welcome to the Knowledge Base - a structured repository of knowledge organized across multiple dimensions to support learning, implementation, and architectural decision-making.

## 🧠 How to Think About This Structure

This knowledge base is organized into **4 dimensions**:

1. **Foundations / Platforms** - Core concepts and vendor-neutral knowledge (Kubernetes, Docker, Cloud, Linux, Networking)
2. **Methods / Ways of Doing Things** - Implementation approaches (install from scratch, managed, k3s vs kubeadm, etc.)
3. **Use-cases / Projects** - Real-world applications (monitoring, APM, CI/CD, logging, security)
4. **Architectures & Decisions** - Design patterns, tradeoffs, and why certain choices were made

The documentation is designed to be:
- **Navigable** - Easy to find what you need
- **Reusable** - Content can be referenced across contexts
- **Comparable** - Compare different approaches side-by-side
- **Evolvable** - Structure scales as knowledge grows

## 📚 Sections

### Foundations
Core concepts and vendor-neutral knowledge. Learn once, reuse forever.

### Platforms
How to run Kubernetes and infrastructure. Real setups, commands, and gotchas.

### Projects
Real-world use cases with complete implementations. Each project includes context, architecture, setup, problems & fixes, and lessons learned.

### Architectures
Design patterns, tradeoffs, and architectural decisions. Includes diagrams, why this design, alternatives, and cost & complexity notes.

### CI/CD
Continuous integration and deployment. Concepts, tools, and implementations.

### Cloud
Provider-specific deep dives for AWS, GCP, Azure, and more.

### Toolbox
Quick references, cheatsheets, and snippets for fast lookup.

### Notes & Deep Dives
Thinking out loud - comparisons, insights, and deep technical explorations.
