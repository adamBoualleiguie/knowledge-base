# Static Export

Guide to exporting your Next.js site as static files for deployment anywhere.

## Step 1: Update next.config.js

Add static export configuration:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  // ... rest of config
}
```

## Step 2: Build

Build the static site:

```bash
yarn build
```

This creates an `out` directory with all static files.

## Step 3: Deploy

Deploy the `out` directory to any static hosting:

- **GitHub Pages**
- **AWS S3**
- **Cloudflare Pages**
- **Any static file server**

## Limitations

Static export has some limitations:

- No server-side features
- No API routes
- No dynamic routes (unless pre-rendered)
- No image optimization (use static images)
