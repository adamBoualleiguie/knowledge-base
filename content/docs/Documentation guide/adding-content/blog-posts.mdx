# Adding Blog Posts

Complete guide to adding blog posts to your portfolio website.

## Understanding Blog Posts

Blog posts are displayed chronologically with tags, dates, and descriptions. They appear on the blog listing page and can be featured on the homepage.

## Step 1: Create a Blog Post File

Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/blog/` directory:

```bash
touch content/blog/my-first-post.mdx
```

**URL**: The file name becomes the URL slug
- `content/blog/my-first-post.mdx` → `/blog/my-first-post`

## Step 2: Add Frontmatter

Blog posts require frontmatter with metadata:

```mdx

# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements. In this post, I'll walk you through getting started with the latest version.

## Introduction

Next.js is a React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications. Version 14 introduces the App Router, Server Components, and many performance improvements.

## What's New in Next.js 14

### App Router

The App Router is now stable and provides a new way to structure your application:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js 14!</h1>
}
```

### Server Components

Server Components allow you to render components on the server:

```typescript
// app/components/ServerComponent.tsx
export default async function ServerComponent() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return <div>{/* Render data */}</div>
}
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── components/
├── public/
└── package.json
```

## Best Practices

1. Use Server Components by default
2. Leverage the App Router for better performance
3. Optimize images with Next.js Image component
4. Use TypeScript for type safety

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 is a powerful framework for building modern web applications. The new features make it easier than ever to create fast, scalable applications.

## Organizing Blog Posts

You can organize blog posts in subfolders:

```
content/blog/
├── 2024/
│   ├── january/
│   │   └── my-post.mdx
│   └── february/
│       └── another-post.mdx
└── 2023/
    └── december/
        └── old-post.mdx
```

**URL Structure:**
- `content/blog/2024/january/my-post.mdx` → `/blog/2024/january/my-post`

## Using Features in Blog Posts

You can use all the same features as documentation:

### Callouts

```mdx
<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
This is a helpful tip for readers.
</Callout>
```

### Code Blocks

````mdx
```javascript
function example() {
  return "Hello, World!";
}
```
````

### Images

```mdx
<DocImage
  src="/assets/blog/images/screenshot.png"
  alt="Screenshot"
  caption="This is a screenshot"
/>
```

### Videos

```mdx
<DocVideo
  src="/assets/blog/videos/demo.mp4"
  caption="Demo video"
  controls
/>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Write engaging descriptions**: They appear in listings
2. **Use tags**: Categorize your posts for better organization
3. **Include dates**: Help readers understand when content was published
4. **Use headings**: Structure long posts with headings
5. **Add examples**: Include code examples and screenshots
6. **Link to related content**: Connect to other posts or documentation

## Display on Homepage

The latest blog posts automatically appear on the homepage. The number of posts shown can be customized in `app/page.tsx`.
