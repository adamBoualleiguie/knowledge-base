# Excalidraw Diagrams

Excalidraw diagrams allow you to embed interactive diagrams in your documentation. These diagrams support theme switching, fullscreen mode, and zoom controls.

## Overview

Excalidraw is a virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like diagrams. You can create diagrams in Excalidraw and embed them in your documentation with full interactivity.

## Features

- ✅ **Theme Support**: Automatically matches your website's theme (light/dark)
- ✅ **Fullscreen Mode**: Click the fullscreen button to view in fullscreen
- ✅ **Zoom Controls**: Zoom in, zoom out, and reset zoom
- ✅ **Centered Display**: Diagrams are automatically centered
- ✅ **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- ✅ **Clean UI**: Default Excalidraw UI elements are hidden for a clean look

## Step 1: Create Your Diagram

1. Go to [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
2. Create your diagram
3. Click the menu (three dots) → **Save to file**
4. Save as `.excalidraw` file (JSON format)

## Step 2: Save the File

Save your `.excalidraw` file in the `public/assets/docs/` directory:

```
public/assets/docs/
├── other/
│   └── diagram.excalidraw
└── knowledge-base/
    └── architectures/
        └── system-architecture.excalidraw
```

## Step 3: Embed in Your Content

Use the `<ExcalidrawDiagram>` component in your MDX:

```mdx
<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/other/diagram.excalidraw"
  caption="Project Architecture Overview"
  initialZoom={0.5}
/>
```

## Component Props

### Required Props

- **`src`**: Path to the `.excalidraw` file (relative to `public/`)
  - Example: `"/assets/docs/other/diagram.excalidraw"`

### Optional Props

- **`alt`**: Alt text for accessibility
  - Example: `"Architecture diagram showing system components"`
  
- **`caption`**: Caption text displayed below the diagram
  - Example: `"Project Architecture Overview"`
  
- **`initialZoom`**: Initial zoom level (default: `1` = 100%)
  - `0.5` = 50% zoom (good for large diagrams)
  - `1` = 100% zoom (default)
  - `2` = 200% zoom (for detailed diagrams)

## Examples

### Basic Diagram

**MDX Syntax:**
```mdx
## Architecture Diagram

Here's a visual representation of the project architecture:

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/other/diagram.excalidraw"
/>
```

**Rendered Result:**

Here's a visual representation of the project architecture:

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/other/diagram.excalidraw"
/>

### Diagram with Caption

**MDX Syntax:**
```mdx
## System Architecture

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/knowledge-base/architectures/system-architecture.excalidraw"
  caption="Complete system architecture showing all components and their relationships"
/>
```

**Rendered Result:**

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/other/diagram.excalidraw"
  caption="Complete system architecture showing all components and their relationships"
/>

### Large Diagram with Custom Zoom

**MDX Syntax:**
```mdx
## Complete System Overview

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/knowledge-base/architectures/complete-system.excalidraw"
  caption="Complete system overview - use zoom controls to explore details"
  initialZoom={0.5}
/>
```

**Rendered Result:**

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/other/diagram.excalidraw"
  caption="Complete system overview - use zoom controls to explore details"
  initialZoom={0.5}
/>

### Diagram with Alt Text

**MDX Syntax:**
```mdx
## Data Flow Diagram

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/other/data-flow.excalidraw"
  alt="Data flow diagram showing how data moves through the system"
  caption="Data Flow Architecture"
/>
```

**Rendered Result:**

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/other/diagram.excalidraw"
  alt="Data flow diagram showing how data moves through the system"
  caption="Data Flow Architecture"
/>

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example using Excalidraw diagrams:

# System Architecture

This document describes the overall system architecture.

## High-Level Overview

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/knowledge-base/architectures/high-level.excalidraw"
  caption="High-level system architecture"
  initialZoom={0.5}
/>

The diagram above shows the main components of our system.

## Detailed Component View

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/knowledge-base/architectures/components.excalidraw"
  caption="Detailed view of individual components"
  initialZoom={1}
/>

This diagram provides a detailed view of each component.

## Data Flow

<ExcalidrawDiagram 
  src="/assets/docs/knowledge-base/architectures/data-flow.excalidraw"
  caption="Data flow through the system"
  initialZoom={0.75}
/>
```

## File Organization

Organize your Excalidraw files logically:

```
public/assets/docs/
├── other/
│   ├── general-diagram.excalidraw
│   └── overview.excalidraw
└── knowledge-base/
    ├── architectures/
    │   ├── system-architecture.excalidraw
    │   ├── data-flow.excalidraw
    │   └── component-diagram.excalidraw
    └── projects/
        └── project-diagram.excalidraw
```

## Zoom Levels

Choose the appropriate initial zoom level:

- **`initialZoom={0.5}`**: Good for large diagrams that need to fit on screen
- **`initialZoom={1}`**: Default - shows diagram at 100%
- **`initialZoom={2}`**: Useful for detailed diagrams that need to be larger

## Controls

The diagram includes a toolbar with:

- **Zoom In** (+): Increase zoom level
- **Zoom Out** (-): Decrease zoom level
- **Reset Zoom**: Return to initial zoom level
- **Fullscreen**: View diagram in fullscreen mode

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive filenames**: `project-architecture.excalidraw`, `data-flow.excalidraw`
2. **Add captions**: Help readers understand what the diagram shows
3. **Choose appropriate zoom**: Large diagrams benefit from `initialZoom={0.5}`
4. **Organize files**: Keep diagrams in logical locations (by section or topic)
5. **Test both themes**: Make sure diagrams look good in both light and dark modes
6. **Add alt text**: Improve accessibility with descriptive alt text

## Troubleshooting

### Diagram Not Loading

- Verify the file path is correct (relative to `public/`)
- Check the file exists in the specified location
- Ensure the file is valid JSON
- Check browser console for errors

### Diagram Not Centered

- The diagram should automatically center on load
- If not centered, check the diagram's element positions in Excalidraw
- Try adjusting the initial zoom level

### Theme Not Matching

- The diagram theme automatically matches your website theme
- If it doesn't match, check that `next-themes` is properly configured
- The diagram uses the same theme as the rest of your site
