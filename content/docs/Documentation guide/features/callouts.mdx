## Features

- ✅ **Auto-generated Titles**: If you don't provide a title, it's auto-generated from the type
- ✅ **Styled Icons**: Each type has a unique icon (Info, CheckCircle, AlertTriangle, etc.)
- ✅ **Color-coded**: Different background and border colors for each type
- ✅ **Excluded from TOC**: Callouts don't appear in the "ON THIS PAGE" table of contents
- ✅ **Responsive**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes
- ✅ **Markdown Support**: You can use markdown inside callouts (lists, bold, code, links)

## Best Practices

1. **Use appropriate types**: Choose the callout type that matches the message importance
2. **Keep titles concise**: Short, descriptive titles work best
3. **Use sparingly**: Don't overuse callouts - they should highlight important information
4. **Combine with inline code**: You can reference files and directories inside callouts using backticks
5. **Use for important information**: Callouts should draw attention to critical information

## Styling

Each callout type has its own color scheme:

- **Info**: Blue background (`bg-blue-500/10`), blue border and text
- **Success**: Green background (`bg-green-500/10`), green border and text
- **Warning**: Yellow background (`bg-yellow-500/10`), yellow border and text
- **Error**: Red background (`bg-red-500/10`), red border and text
- **Note**: Purple background (`bg-purple-500/10`), purple border and text
- **Danger**: Red background (`bg-red-500/10`), red border and text
