# Table of Contents

The "ON THIS PAGE" sidebar automatically extracts headings from your document content and creates a table of contents.

## Overview

The table of contents appears on the right side of documentation pages and automatically updates as you scroll, highlighting the current section.

## Features

- ✅ **Automatic Extraction**: Headings (H2, H3, H4) are automatically extracted from your MDX content
- ✅ **Hierarchical Display**: Headings are shown with proper indentation based on level
- ✅ **Smooth Scrolling**: Clicking a heading smoothly scrolls to that section
- ✅ **Active Highlighting**: The current section is highlighted as you scroll
- ✅ **Dynamic Updates**: Updates when switching tabs in tabbed content
- ✅ **Excludes Callouts**: Headings inside callout components are excluded

## What Gets Displayed

- ✅ **H2 Headings** (##): Main sections - shown in bold
- ✅ **H3 Headings** (###): Subsections - indented
- ✅ **H4 Headings** (####): Sub-subsections - more indented
- ❌ **H1 Headings** (#): Page title - excluded from TOC
- ❌ **Code Examples**: Headings in code blocks are ignored
- ❌ **Callout Headings**: Headings inside callout components are excluded
- ❌ **Tab Content**: Headings in inactive tabs are excluded (active tab headings are included)

## Example

For a document with these headings:

```mdx
# Page Title (not in TOC)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
### Steps

## Configuration
### Basic Setup
### Advanced Options
```

The TOC will show:
- **Installation** (H2 - bold)
  - Prerequisites (H3 - indented)
  - Steps (H3 - indented)
- **Configuration** (H2 - bold)
  - Basic Setup (H3 - indented)
  - Advanced Options (H3 - indented)

## How It Works

1. **On Page Load**: Headings are automatically extracted from the rendered content
2. **As You Scroll**: The active heading is highlighted based on scroll position
3. **On Tab Switch**: If you have tabbed content, the TOC updates when you switch tabs
4. **On Content Change**: The TOC automatically updates if content changes dynamically

## Best Practices

1. **Use H2 for main sections**: These appear as top-level items in the TOC
2. **Use H3 for subsections**: These appear indented under H2 headings
3. **Use H4 for deeper nesting**: These appear more indented
4. **Avoid using H1 in content**: It's reserved for the page title
5. **Structure logically**: Use a clear hierarchy for better navigation
6. **Keep headings descriptive**: Help users understand what each section covers

## Tips

- The TOC automatically appears on documentation pages
- It's positioned on the right side of the content
- It's sticky and stays visible as you scroll
- Click any heading to jump to that section
- The active section is highlighted with a colored indicator

## Visual Indicator

The active heading in the TOC has:
- A colored vertical line on the left
- Bold text
- Active color highlighting
