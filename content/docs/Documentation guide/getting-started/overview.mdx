# Getting Started

This section will help you get started quickly with your portfolio website. Learn the basic concepts and structure.

## Understanding the Structure

Your portfolio website uses a hierarchical structure for documentation:

- **Sections** (top level) - Major categories like "Guide", "Knowledge Base"
- **Subsections** (second level) - Categories within sections like "Getting Started", "Features"
- **Documents** (individual pages) - The actual content files

## File Structure

All content is stored in the `content/` directory:

```
content/
├── docs/              # Documentation files
│   ├── guide/        # Guide section
│   └── knowledge-base/ # Knowledge Base section
└── blog/              # Blog posts
```

## Basic Concepts

### Frontmatter

Every content file needs frontmatter at the top:

```mdx
---
title: Your Document Title
description: A brief description
publishedAt: 2024-01-15
updatedAt: 2024-01-20  # Optional
---
```

### URL Structure

The URL matches your folder structure:

- `content/docs/guide/overview.mdx` → `/docs/guide/overview`
- `content/docs/guide/getting-started/overview.mdx` → `/docs/guide/getting-started/overview`
- `content/blog/my-post.mdx` → `/blog/my-post`

### Overview Pages

Major sections can have overview pages that describe what the section contains. When an overview page exists, the section title becomes clickable in the sidebar.
